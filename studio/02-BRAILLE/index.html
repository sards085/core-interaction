      <p> Braille is universally defined as a tactile writing system used by people who are visually impaired. Invented in 1824 by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louis_Braille" class="louis">Louis Braille</a>, it consists of a code of 63 characters, each made up of up to 6 raised dots arranged in a six-position cell. The Braille dots are embossed onto the page, and are to be read from left to right.
      <br>
      <br>
          Louis, fed up with the makeshift writing systems that existed for the visually impaired at the time, drew inspiration from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Night_writing" class="night-writing">night writing</a> when developing Braille. Night writing, also known as sonography, was developed by a French soldier during the Napoleonic Wars as a way to communicate inconspicuously at night. <a href="http://www.historytoday.com/stephen-bertman/louis-braille-and-night-writer" class="sonography">Sonography</a> used a system of up to twelve dots arranged in two columns of up to six dots each. Louis’s modification of this system involved simply cutting the 12-dot cell in half.

      <br>
      <br>
        Fast-forward nearly 200 years later, and less than 10% of legally blind Americans now read Braille. With the advancement of technology, use of the writing system has become <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/03/magazine/03Braille-t.html">less and less common</a>. Given that so much information is now digitized, nearly anything can be conveyed using audio.
      <br>
      <br>
        <a href="#viewfont">Braille Neue</a> is a commentary on the effects digitalization of information has had on the use of Braille throughout the blind community. With letterforms whose dimensions mirror their Braille counterparts, <a href="#viewfont">Braille Neue</a> is a guide to reading the slowly fading writing system. However, it’s existence as a digital, two-dimensional typeface renders it unreadable to it’s only audience.
