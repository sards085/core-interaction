      <p> Braille is universally defined as a tactile writing system used by people who are visually impaired. Invented in 1824 by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louis_Braille" class="louis">Louis Braille</a>, it consists of a code of 63 characters, each made up of up to 6 raised dots arranged in a six-position cell. The Braille dots are embossed onto the page, and are to be read from left to right.

          Louis, fed up with the makeshift writing systems that existed for the visually impaired at the time, drew inspiration from night writing when developing Braille. Night writing, also known as sonography, was developed by a French soldier during the Napoleonic Wars as a way to communicate inconspicuously at night. Sonography used a system of up to twelve dots arranged in two columns of up to six dots each. Louisâ€™s modification of this system involved simply cutting the 12-dot cell in half.
