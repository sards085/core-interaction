            Over the course of this project inspiration has slowly unearthed itself, becoming more readily digestible. When I first began my research, modular or combinatorial type systems seemed alien and impossible to uncover— a mystery I became enthralled by.
            <br><br>
            Since this website’s inception, I’ve gathered a sizable amount of visuals, projects, websites, and identity systems that didn’t make the final cut. Where initially my biggest concern was finding enough content to write about, I now find myself drowning in a sea of inspiring projects.
            <br><br>
            Another observation I’ve made throughout my quest for content: not one archive for modular, combinatorial type systems exists on the internet. Even within online graphic design archives, like designspiration, it was to find examples of the kinds of projects I sought after. This kind of work deserves to be shared, discussed, and readily available to those intrigued by it (I imagine I can’t be the only one so devoutly interested in typographical modularity).
            <br><br>
            I finally have an archive of work that excites me. I can only hope others join me in my excitement, making use of an archive that the internet was devoid of not too long ago.
