            In 2017, the Italian Association for Visual Communication Design hosted a competition for the rebranding of the University of Campania Luigi Vanvitelli. Milleunomiglia, an interdisciplinary studio in Italy decided to take part because it was “an opportunity to demonstrate our skills as a design collective publicly.” Comprised of four designers, the studio focuses on editorial and digital work. Their work wasn’t selected as winner, but their proposed identity system serves as yet another great example of combinatorial typographic work.
            <blockquote>
              “The Vanvitelli University is a poly-centric structure, characterised by the union of the three poles of knowledge (humanistic, scientific, polytechnic) and intends to communicate itself as an inclusive, innovative, international and open institution.”
            </blockquote>
            It’s these characteristics that inspired the studio to use the exchange of knowledge, an idea that is encouraged by the university, as grounds for their modular system.
            <blockquote>
              “This inspired us to create a typographic language, thought up or thought through specifically for the university, an experimental font generated from a mixture of three typographic styles drawn on a geometric and modular basis.”
            </blockquote>
            The multiple variations were generated by use of complementary shapes, each representing the different pillars of knowledge that make up the university.
